# Physical-Chemistry-CHEM302-
Code for visualizing and solving quantum mechanics based chemistry problems.

FIRST CODE: 1D and 2D PIB
Starting with a plot of the 1-dimensional particle in a box (1DPIB) wave function: (2/Lx)**(1/2)*np.sin((nx*np.pi*x)/Lx)
Then, plotting the 2D wavefunction: (2/(Lx*Ly)**(1/2))*np.sin((nx*np.pi*x)/Lx)*sin((ny*np.pi*y)/Ly)
Lx = arbitrary length of 'box' in x dimension
Ly = arbitrary length of 'box' in y dimension
nx = quantum number for energy level (in terms of x)
ny = quantum number for energy level (in terms of y)
x = position of particle

Just adding a line to test a local change.
